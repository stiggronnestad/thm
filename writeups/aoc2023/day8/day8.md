## Steps

Task completed using the split-view online.

I'm tasked with investigating a malicius USB flash drive that was plugged into `Van Jollys` laptop using `FTK Imager`, this seems like a fun one.

The USB drive is called `Ckr3Ts4uC3` - SecretSauce?

The task was completed using the `FTK Imager` software.

## Question 1

> What is the malware C2 server?

I found this by clicking around the `Evidence Tree` and finding `secretchat.txt`. This is a conversation between `Gr33dYsH4d0W` and `V4nd4LmUffL3r5`.

## Question 2

> What is the file inside the deleted zip archive?

Files marked with an X are deleted, they can still be investigated.

## Question 3

> What flag is hidden in one of the deleted PNG files?

I can search for strings in one of the two `.png` files found on the drive. I did this in hex mode by converting `THM` to hex and searching for the hex codes.

## Question 4

> What is the SHA1 hash of the physical drive and forensic image?

Run Drive/Image verification to get the hash.
